# Descriptive Statistics Exercises Project

![Preview](assets/preview.jpeg)

## Overview

This project provides hands-on exercises for learning descriptive statistics using Python. You'll work with a real dataset of 1000 popular movies from IMDb to explore various statistical concepts including measures of central tendency, spread, and distribution shape.

## What You'll Learn

- **Data Analysis with Pandas**: Load and manipulate real-world datasets
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation
- **Distribution Analysis**: Understand skewness and kurtosis
- **Data Visualization**: Create histograms and interpret statistical plots
- **Manual Calculations**: Step-by-step computation of standard deviation

## Project Features

- **Modular Code Structure**: Functions are organized in separate modules for better maintainability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests ensure code reliability and correctness
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step exercises with detailed explanations
- **Real Dataset Analysis**: Work with actual IMDb movie data
- **Statistical Visualizations**: Generate professional-quality plots and charts

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Movie Title Length Analysis
Analyze the length of movie titles in the IMDb dataset:

1. **Create Title Length Column** - Calculate character count for each title
2. **Central Tendency Measures** - Compute mean, median, and mode
3. **Measures of Spread** - Calculate range, variance, and standard deviation
4. **Distribution Shape** - Analyze skewness and kurtosis
5. **Extreme Values** - Find shortest and longest movie titles
6. **Visualization and Summary** - Create histogram with statistical markers

*The distribution plot shows the frequency of movie title lengths with key statistical measures marked: mean (red), median (green), and Â±1 standard deviation (orange).*

### Exercise 2: Manual Standard Deviation Calculation
Learn the mathematical foundation by manually calculating standard deviation:

1. **Select Sample Data** - Choose 5 title lengths from the dataset
2. **Calculate the Mean** - Compute average of selected values
3. **Calculate Squared Differences** - Find deviations from the mean
4. **Variance and Standard Deviation** - Complete the calculation and verify results

## Code Organization

### Functions Module (`notebook/functions.py`)
The project includes a dedicated functions module containing:

- `add_title_length_features()`: Adds title length calculations to DataFrames
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Clear documentation and type hints

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_functions.py`)
Comprehensive test suite covering:

- âœ… Basic functionality with default parameters
- âœ… Custom column names and parameters
- âœ… Error handling for invalid inputs
- âœ… Edge cases (empty DataFrames, NaN values)
- âœ… Special characters and Unicode support
- âœ… Data integrity (original DataFrame preservation)

**Run tests**:
```bash
python tests/test_functions.py
```

## Getting Started

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository**:
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. **Open in Codespaces**:
